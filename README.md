# editorial-fork

Changes:
-Removed "Full Story / Read More" buttons because they feel redundant when you can also click on the article headers
-Reformatted main.css to make it more editable
-Modified CSS to make small changes to the appearance & scaling behaviour on PC, such as text width on articles, header format and colours.  Mobile scaling should be unchanged unless I've made a mistake.
